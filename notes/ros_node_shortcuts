Some of this is theoretical because we haven't tied it all in together and made it work

RUNNING THE CAR
Source our ROS code:
>>> source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
OR
>>> . ~/ros_setup.sh

BUILDING CODE (esp w/ cpp, or new msg)
on initial run/build:
>>> cd ~/catkin_ws
>>> catkin_make
>>> catkin_make install
No need to do 'source install/setup.bash'!

ROS
Must ALWAYS run 'roscore' first and have it running:
>>> roscore

KEYBOARD CONTROL
>>> rosrun race keyboard.py

RUNNING TALKER
>>> rosrun race talker.py

RUNNING TEENSY
>>> rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0

## end of week 1 --> keyboard control

RUNNING KILL SWITCH
>>> rosrun race kill.py # doesn't do anything but still
curses.KEY_HOME for mac: Fn+left
curses.KEY_DC for mac: Fn+Delete

RUNNING HOKUYO
>>> rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:="192.168.1.11"

RUNNING IMU
>>> roslaunch razor_imu_9dof razor-pub.launch
(to visualise: >>> roslaunch razor_imu_9dof razor-pub-and-display.launch)
