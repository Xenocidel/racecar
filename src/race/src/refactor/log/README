Running the car with output to log (no screen): `roslaunch race race2log.launch`
Log will be written to `~/.ros/log/latest/driver-5-stdout.log`

Log formatting:
 [Duration since car init, seconds in float to 3 decimal places]
 {Alert/State/Motor/Angle}
 {value}


Example:

[8.209] State: COLLISION AVOID
[8.210] Motor: 10.0%
[8.210] Angle: -29.784487537

[10.791] State: auto
[10.791] Alert: left 0.493800002337
[10.791] Motor: 20.0%
[10.791] Angle: 12.6037489426

Currently there are 2 possible states: 'auto' or 'COLLISION AVOID'

Alerts may include:
    'left' or 'right', followed by the distance to the left or right wall in meters
    'motors killed', which indicates that the velocity is set to 0

Motor speed ranges from -100% to 100%

Angle ranges from -100 to 100 (this maps to approximately -30 to 30 degrees)
    Left is negative, right is positive, straight ahead is zero
